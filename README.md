## Difficulties

- Routes were the lesson of Unit 6. I implemented the routes on my webpage but the difficulty is I'm making my API pull in my Info.jsx, which is the child component of App.jsx. In order for me to fulfill all the other requirements I needed to send the information from info.jsx to be sent up to app.jsx to be sent down again.

- The layout of my initial project was not easy to debug to setup proper passing of data. It was hard to just convert this into a properly structured routing app.
